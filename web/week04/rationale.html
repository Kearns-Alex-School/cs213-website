		<h1>Interface Design</h1>

		<p>
			Rationale: Although I had a basic use of navigation, some of the items I felt did not flow very well.
			So I made a more definite design with a header, navigation bar, side-navigation, main content, and then
			a footer at the very bottom. This design became easier to keep across both pages because the CSS took on
			more of the design. I also used the < div > tag to organize the code more.

		<h1>Role of Graphics</h1>
		<p><a href="https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/11-graphics/2-graphics-as-content.html">Guideline Link</a></p>
		<p>
			Rationale: I felt that the two images on the top was too much and restricted my title from being bigger.
			The new image is smaller and now only on one side to act as another link to the home. The borders of the 
			"random" puns are also smaller to make it more visually attractive. New colors to make the whole page
			come together and match each of the other elements.
